## <a id="introduction"></a> Introduction
### Goal of the analysis
Taste preferences for food and drinks often go beyond the intrinsic characteristics of the items themselves and are in reality shaped by various external influences. Cultural differences are a prime example: while highly spiced dishes are popular in many South Asian countries, milder flavors are often preferred in Western Europe. This project examines similar external factors that shape beer preferences, aiming to uncover what truly drives an individual’s taste in beers. We analyze how different beer characteristics are appreciated across selected countries and assess whether the origin of a beer biases the ratings it receives. Additionally, we investigate how seasonal variations and user experience impact the enjoyment of specific beer categories. By identifying these “external” influences, we hope to help beer enthusiasts better understand their preferences and make choices based more on intrinsic qualities, ultimately improving their sensory experience and enjoyment of beer.

### Dataset
The dataset for this analysis comprises beer reviews collected from two popular beer rating platforms, BeerAdvocate and RateBeer, covering a period from 2001 to 2017. For each website, the dataset includes metadata on reviewers, beers, and breweries, along with detailed user reviews. In total, there are records of over 500,000 unique beers produced by breweries in more than 200 countries. Among the most frequently reviewed beer styles are American IPA and India Pale Ale. The dataset also includes approximately 200,000 users from over 200 countries, though the distribution of users and breweries is heavily skewed: the vast majority are located in the United States on both platforms. Overall, the dataset contains over 8 million reviews from BeerAdvocate and 7 million from RateBeer. For the parts of our analysis that involve country comparisons, we excluded reviews from countries with fewer than 50 reviewers to ensure that the data is representative at a national level.
