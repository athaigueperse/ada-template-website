# Selective sips: cultural and bias trends in beer preferences across countries
## _by DataPilots_

Taste preferences for food and drinks often go beyond the intrinsic characteristics of the items themselves and are in reality shaped by various external influences. Cultural differences are a prime example: while highly spiced dishes are popular in many South Asian countries, milder flavors are often preferred in Western Europe. This project examines similar external factors that shape beer preferences, aiming to uncover what truly drives an individual’s taste in beers. We analyze how different beer characteristics are appreciated across selected countries and assess whether the origin of a beer biases the ratings it receives. Additionally, we investigate how seasonal variations and user experience impact the enjoyment of specific beer categories. By identifying these “external” influences, we hope to help beer enthusiasts better understand their preferences and make choices based more on intrinsic qualities, ultimately improving their sensory experience and enjoyment of beer.
